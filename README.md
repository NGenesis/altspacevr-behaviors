# AltspaceVR Behaviors
Behavior types for common functionality compatible with AltspaceVR SDK's behavior design pattern.

* altspace.utilties.behaviors.OrbitalControls
 * Provides a convenience wrapper for THREE.OrbitControls when working with [altspace.utilties.Simulation](https://altspacevr.github.io/AltspaceSDK/doc/module-altspace_utilities.Simulation.html).
* altspace.utilties.behaviors.UserEvents
 * Subscribes to avatar and user preference update events for a given list of users.

**Please be aware that these behaviors may become deprecated over time as the Altspace SDK changes and new functionality is introduced.**
